# Feature Specification: Mobile Google OAuth Integration

**Feature Branch**: `003-mobile-google-oauth`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Mobile app'de Google OAuth flow'u implement et, kullan1c1 chat üzerinden Google hesab1n1 balayabilsin"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Mobile Google OAuth with incremental permissions
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Mobile app users
   ’ Actions: OAuth flow, permission granting, error handling
   ’ Data: User profile, access tokens, Google service connections
   ’ Constraints: Security, incremental permissions, smooth UX
3. All aspects clarified through Q&A session
4. User scenarios defined for OAuth flow and error cases
5. Functional requirements generated covering authentication and permissions
6. Key entities identified (User, OAuth Token, Permission Scope)
7. Review checklist completed - no clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Mobile app users can seamlessly connect their Google account through a conversational interface. The system requests permissions incrementally based on user needs, starting with basic profile access and expanding to include Calendar, Gmail, and Tasks as users request these features. Failed authentication is handled gracefully with clear retry options.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user opens the app for the first time, **When** they see the chat interface, **Then** AI proactively offers Google account connection with clear benefits
2. **Given** user agrees to connect Google account, **When** OAuth flow is initiated, **Then** system browser opens with Google login and user is redirected back to app upon success
3. **Given** user successfully connects basic profile, **When** they request calendar access ("check my calendar"), **Then** system requests calendar permissions incrementally
4. **Given** user tries to access Gmail features, **When** they don't have email permissions, **Then** system requests Gmail permissions specifically
5. **Given** OAuth flow fails, **When** error occurs, **Then** user receives clear error message with specific reason and retry option
6. **Given** user has connected their account, **When** they restart the app, **Then** authentication persists and no re-login is required

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user cancels OAuth flow midway?
- How does system handle network connectivity issues during OAuth?
- What if user revokes permissions from Google side while app is running?
- How are expired tokens handled transparently?
- What happens if user has multiple Google accounts and picks wrong one?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide proactive Google account connection offer in initial chat interaction
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement incremental permission model starting with profile+email+calendar
- **FR-003**: System MUST use system browser for OAuth flow with deep link return to app
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle OAuth cancellation gracefully without blocking app usage
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide specific error messages for different OAuth failure scenarios
- **FR-006**: System MUST offer retry mechanism for failed OAuth attempts
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist authentication state across app restarts
- **FR-008**: System MUST request additional permissions (Gmail, Tasks) when user attempts to use those features
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle token expiration transparently with automatic refresh
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear visual feedback during OAuth process (loading states)
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to disconnect Google account if desired
- **FR-012**: System MUST work in limited mode if user chooses not to connect Google account

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: App user with optional Google account connection, stores authentication state and permission levels
- **OAuth Token**: Session token stored locally with expiration, linked to backend refresh token for security
- **Permission Scope**: Incremental permission levels (basic, calendar, email, tasks) with user consent tracking
- **Auth Session**: OAuth flow state management including PKCE parameters and callback handling
