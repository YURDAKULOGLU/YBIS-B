# Feature Specification: Adaptive UI System for Vertical Applications

**Feature Branch**: `006-adaptive-ui-system`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Adaptive UI system that transforms interface based on vertical application (LawBIS, DocBIS, StudBIS) while maintaining core functionality"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   â†’ Feature: Dynamic UI adaptation for vertical-specific applications
2. Extract key concepts from description
   â†’ Actors: End users, App administrators, Vertical content providers
   â†’ Actions: Switch vertical modes, adapt interface, maintain functionality, customize features
   â†’ Data: UI configurations, vertical settings, feature modules, user preferences
   â†’ Constraints: Single codebase, seamless transitions, consistent core experience
3. All aspects clarified through Q&A session
4. User scenarios defined for vertical switching and interface adaptation
5. Functional requirements generated covering UI modularity and adaptation
6. Key entities identified (Vertical Profile, UI Module, Feature Set, Adaptation Engine)
7. Review checklist completed - no clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Guidelines
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ðŸš« Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- ðŸ‘¥ Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users can access specialized vertical applications (LawBIS for legal professionals, DocBIS for medical practitioners, StudBIS for students) through a single app that adapts its interface, features, and content to match their professional needs. The core chat and dashboard functionality remains consistent while specialized tools, terminology, and workflows appear based on the selected vertical.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user selects LawBIS mode, **When** interface loads, **Then** legal-specific terminology, case law features, and legal document tools appear
2. **Given** user switches from LawBIS to DocBIS, **When** transition occurs, **Then** medical terminology, patient management tools, and medical reference materials replace legal features
3. **Given** user is in StudBIS mode, **When** they access study tools, **Then** flashcards, academic calendar, and research features are prominently displayed
4. **Given** user changes vertical, **When** core features are accessed, **Then** chat, notes, and basic calendar functionality remain consistent across all verticals
5. **Given** user has multiple vertical subscriptions, **When** they switch modes, **Then** their data and preferences persist within each vertical context
6. **Given** new user selects a vertical, **When** onboarding begins, **Then** vertical-specific welcome flow and feature introduction appears

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user has no vertical selected (default mode)?
- How does system handle unsupported features in certain verticals?
- What if user tries to access restricted vertical without subscription?
- How are data conflicts handled when switching between verticals?
- What happens during vertical transitions if network is unavailable?
- How does system handle partial vertical feature loading?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide vertical selection interface during initial setup and in settings
- **FR-002**: System MUST adapt main dashboard layout based on selected vertical (LawBIS, DocBIS, StudBIS)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display vertical-specific terminology and language throughout the interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST show/hide features based on vertical requirements and subscriptions
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain core functionality (chat, notes, calendar) consistently across all verticals
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide smooth transitions when switching between vertical modes
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist user preferences and data separately for each vertical context
- **FR-008**: System MUST support multiple concurrent vertical access for users with multiple subscriptions
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide vertical-specific onboarding flows and tutorials
- **FR-010**: System MUST adapt mini-widgets and dashboard components based on vertical priorities
- **FR-011**: System MUST display vertical-appropriate color schemes, icons, and branding elements
- **FR-012**: System MUST restrict access to vertical-specific features based on user permissions
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide default/general mode for users without specific vertical selection
- **FR-014**: System MUST support easy vertical switching through settings or quick-switch interface
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain performance standards regardless of vertical complexity

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Vertical Profile**: Configuration defining interface adaptations, available features, and branding for each vertical
- **UI Module**: Reusable interface component that can be shown/hidden or modified based on vertical context
- **Feature Set**: Collection of functionality specific to each vertical with access control and customization
- **Adaptation Engine**: System managing interface transitions, data context switching, and feature availability
- **User Vertical Preferences**: Individual user settings and customizations within each vertical context
