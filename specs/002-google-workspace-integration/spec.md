# Feature Specification: Google Workspace Integration

**Feature Branch**: `002-google-workspace-integration`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Google Workspace ile kullan1c1 hesab1n1n balanmas1 ki google calendar tasks ve gmail balanabilsin"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Google Workspace (Calendar + Tasks) integration for MVP
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: End users, External API consumers
   ’ Actions: OAuth connection, bidirectional sync, view/edit calendar/tasks
   ’ Data: Calendar events, Tasks, User authentication tokens
   ’ Constraints: MVP scope, real-time sync, last-write-wins conflict resolution
3. All aspects clarified through Q&A session
4. User scenarios defined for OAuth flow and sync operations
5. Functional requirements generated covering authentication and sync
6. Key entities identified (User, Calendar Event, Task, Sync Session)
7. Review checklist completed - no clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users can connect their Google Workspace account with a single button click to enable bidirectional synchronization between the app and their Google Calendar/Tasks. Users can view and manage their calendar events and tasks within the app, with changes automatically reflected in Google services and vice versa.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user is logged into the app, **When** they click "Connect Google Account", **Then** OAuth flow opens and successfully links their Google account
2. **Given** user has connected Google account, **When** initial sync completes, **Then** last 30 days of calendar events and all pending tasks appear in the app
3. **Given** user creates a new calendar event in the app, **When** they save it, **Then** event appears in their Google Calendar
4. **Given** user marks a task complete in Google Tasks, **When** sync occurs, **Then** task shows as completed in the app
5. **Given** user modifies an event simultaneously in app and Google Calendar, **When** sync occurs, **Then** last modification wins

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Google API is unavailable during sync?
- How does system handle OAuth token expiration?
- What if user disconnects Google account while sync is in progress?
- How are sync conflicts logged for debugging?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide single-click Google Workspace OAuth authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST perform initial sync of last 30 days calendar events upon connection
- **FR-003**: System MUST perform initial sync of all pending Google Tasks upon connection
- **FR-004**: System MUST enable bidirectional synchronization of calendar events (title, date/time, description)
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable bidirectional synchronization of tasks (title, completion status, due date, description)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide calendar view displaying synced events
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide task view displaying synced tasks
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to create, edit, and delete calendar events through the app
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to create, edit, and complete tasks through the app
- **FR-010**: System MUST apply last-write-wins strategy for conflict resolution
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain real-time sync between app and Google services
- **FR-012**: External systems MUST be able to access synced data via API endpoints

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents app user with Google Workspace connection, stores OAuth tokens and sync preferences
- **Calendar Event**: Represents calendar entry with title, date/time, description, sync status with Google Calendar
- **Task**: Represents task item with title, completion status, due date, description, sync status with Google Tasks
- **Sync Session**: Represents synchronization operation tracking conflicts, timestamps, and success/failure status
