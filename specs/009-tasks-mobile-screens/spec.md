**Feature Branch**: `009-tasks-mobile-screens`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Complete mobile task management interface with Google Tasks integration, list views, and task completion workflows"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   â†’ Feature: Full mobile task management UI with Google Tasks sync
2. Extract key concepts from description
   â†’ Actors: Mobile users, Google Tasks service, Task collaborators
   â†’ Actions: View tasks, create tasks, mark complete, organize by priority, sync with Google
   â†’ Data: Task items, completion status, due dates, priority levels, sync status
   â†’ Constraints: Mobile interface, touch interactions, offline capability, real-time sync
3. All aspects clarified through Q&A session
4. User scenarios defined for task management and productivity workflows
5. Functional requirements generated covering task UI and functionality
6. Key entities identified (Task List, Task Item, Priority Filter, Completion Status)
7. Review checklist completed - no clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Guidelines
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ðŸš« Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- ðŸ‘¥ Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users can manage their tasks through a dedicated mobile interface that syncs with Google Tasks, displaying tasks in organized lists with priority indicators, allowing quick task creation and completion, and providing filtering options for better productivity management. The interface supports both quick task actions and detailed task management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user taps tasks mini-widget, **When** tasks screen opens, **Then** task list displays with pending tasks organized by priority and due date
2. **Given** user wants to create task, **When** they tap "Add Task" button, **Then** create task form opens with title, due date, and priority options
3. **Given** user creates new task, **When** they save it, **Then** task appears in list and syncs to Google Tasks with confirmation
4. **Given** user sees completed task, **When** they tap checkbox, **Then** task marks as complete with visual feedback and syncs to Google
5. **Given** user taps existing task, **When** task details open, **Then** they can view/edit title, due date, description, and priority
6. **Given** user applies filter, **When** filter selection changes, **Then** task list updates to show only matching tasks (pending, completed, priority level)
7. **Given** user swipes on task, **When** swipe gesture completes, **Then** quick action options appear (complete, edit, delete)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to create task without network connection?
- How does interface handle tasks with past due dates?
- What if user has hundreds of tasks in the list?
- How are recurring tasks from Google displayed and managed?
- What happens when task sync fails or conflicts occur?
- How does interface handle very long task titles or descriptions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display task list with pending tasks prominently shown at top
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide visual indicators for task priority levels (high, medium, low)
- **FR-003**: System MUST show due dates with clear formatting and overdue highlighting
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide prominent "Add Task" button or FAB for task creation
- **FR-005**: System MUST offer create task form with title, due date, description, and priority fields
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow quick task completion via checkbox tap with immediate visual feedback
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide task detail view accessible by tapping task item
- **FR-008**: System MUST support task editing with save/cancel functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow task deletion with confirmation dialog
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide filtering options (All, Pending, Completed, By Priority)
- **FR-011**: System MUST sync all task changes bidirectionally with Google Tasks
- **FR-012**: System MUST support swipe gestures for quick actions (complete, edit, delete)
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle offline task operations with sync queue when connection returns
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide pull-to-refresh functionality for manual sync
- **FR-015**: System MUST display sync status and handle sync errors gracefully

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task List**: Main interface managing task display, filtering, and organization
- **Task Item**: Individual task with title, due date, description, priority, and completion status
- **Priority Filter**: User-selectable filter controlling which tasks are visible based on criteria
- **Completion Status**: Task state management tracking pending/completed status with sync state
