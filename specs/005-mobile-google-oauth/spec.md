# Feature Specification: Mobile Google OAuth Integration

**Feature Branch**: `005-mobile-google-oauth`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Mobile Google OAuth flow implementation for Google Workspace integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   â†’ Feature: Complete Google OAuth flow on mobile platform
2. Extract key concepts from description
   â†’ Actors: Mobile users, Google OAuth servers, Backend API
   â†’ Actions: Sign in, authorize permissions, handle tokens, maintain session
   â†’ Data: OAuth tokens, user permissions, authentication state
   â†’ Constraints: Mobile platform limitations, secure token storage, seamless UX
3. All aspects clarified through Q&A session
4. User scenarios defined for authentication flows and error handling
5. Functional requirements generated covering OAuth implementation
6. Key entities identified (Auth Session, OAuth Token, User Permissions)
7. Review checklist completed - no clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Guidelines
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ðŸš« Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- ðŸ‘¥ Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users can seamlessly connect their Google Workspace account through the mobile app with a single "Connect Google" button. The OAuth flow opens in a secure browser, allows permission granting, and returns users to the app with full access to their Google services (Calendar, Gmail, Tasks). The connection persists across app sessions and automatically refreshes tokens when needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user opens the app for the first time, **When** they tap "Connect Google Account", **Then** secure OAuth browser opens with Google login
2. **Given** user completes Google authorization, **When** they grant permissions, **Then** app receives tokens and shows "Connected" status
3. **Given** user has connected their account, **When** they restart the app, **Then** authentication persists without requiring re-login
4. **Given** user's tokens expire, **When** app needs Google data, **Then** tokens refresh automatically without user intervention
5. **Given** user wants to disconnect, **When** they tap "Disconnect Google", **Then** all tokens are cleared and user returns to unauthenticated state
6. **Given** user denies permissions, **When** OAuth flow completes, **Then** app shows helpful message about required permissions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user cancels OAuth flow midway?
- How does app handle network disconnection during OAuth?
- What if Google services are temporarily unavailable?
- How are expired refresh tokens handled?
- What happens when user changes Google account password?
- How does app handle permission scope changes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide "Connect Google Account" button in unauthenticated state
- **FR-002**: System MUST open OAuth flow in secure in-app browser or system browser
- **FR-003**: System MUST request necessary Google scopes (Profile, Email, Calendar, Tasks, Gmail)
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle OAuth callback and extract authorization code
- **FR-005**: System MUST exchange authorization code for access and refresh tokens via backend
- **FR-006**: System MUST store authentication state securely in device storage
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist authentication across app restarts and device reboots
- **FR-008**: System MUST automatically refresh access tokens when expired
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide visual feedback during OAuth flow (loading states, progress)
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle OAuth errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to disconnect/revoke Google account access
- **FR-012**: System MUST clear all stored tokens and data when user disconnects
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate token authenticity and scope permissions before API calls
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle permission denial scenarios with explanatory messaging
- **FR-015**: System MUST support re-authentication flow when refresh tokens become invalid

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Auth Session**: Mobile authentication state managing user login status and token validity
- **OAuth Token**: Secure token pair (access/refresh) with expiration and scope information
- **User Permissions**: Google service permissions granted by user with scope validation
- **Auth State**: Persistent authentication data including user info and connection status
