# Feature Specification: Main Dashboard Layout

**Feature Branch**: `004-main-dashboard-layout`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Single-screen dashboard with chat-dominant layout and mini widgets"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   â†’ Feature: Main dashboard layout with chat and mini widgets
2. Extract key concepts from description
   â†’ Actors: End users, Mobile app interface
   â†’ Actions: View dashboard, interact with chat, monitor mini widgets, navigate to full views
   â†’ Data: Chat conversations, Widget states, Navigation context
   â†’ Constraints: Single-screen approach, Mobile-first design, Real-time updates
3. All aspects clarified through Q&A session
4. User scenarios defined for dashboard interactions and navigation
5. Functional requirements generated covering layout and behavior
6. Key entities identified (Dashboard, Chat Area, Mini Widget, Full View)
7. Review checklist completed - no clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Guidelines
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ðŸš« Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- ðŸ‘¥ Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users open the YBIS app to a single dashboard screen where they can immediately see their daily context (mini widgets for calendar, email, tasks) while having the chat interface as the primary interaction method. Users can get quick overviews from mini widgets and access detailed views when needed, all while maintaining chat-driven workflow automation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user opens the app, **When** dashboard loads, **Then** chat area is prominently displayed with mini widgets visible at the top
2. **Given** user asks chat to "add meeting tomorrow", **When** confirmation is given, **Then** chat shows success message AND calendar mini widget animates to show change
3. **Given** user taps on calendar mini widget, **When** interaction occurs, **Then** full calendar view opens with navigation back to dashboard
4. **Given** user receives new email, **When** notification arrives, **Then** email mini widget updates with visual indication
5. **Given** user is in chat conversation, **When** they reference calendar data, **Then** mini widgets provide contextual information without leaving chat
6. **Given** user performs multiple actions, **When** changes occur, **Then** each relevant mini widget provides visual feedback (animation, sound, state change)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when mini widget data fails to load?
- How does layout adapt to different screen sizes?
- What if user has too many concurrent conversations?
- How are mini widgets prioritized when screen space is limited?
- What happens during network connectivity issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display chat interface as the primary interaction area taking majority of screen space
- **FR-002**: System MUST show mini widgets for calendar, email, and tasks at the top of dashboard
- **FR-003**: Mini widgets MUST provide at-a-glance information without requiring navigation
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide visual feedback (animation) when mini widget states change due to user actions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide audio feedback (click sounds) for confirmed actions
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to tap mini widgets to open corresponding full-screen views
- **FR-007**: Full-screen views MUST provide clear navigation back to main dashboard
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain chat context when navigating between views
- **FR-009**: Mini widgets MUST update in real-time when changes occur through chat commands
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement confirmation dialogs for chat-initiated actions before execution
- **FR-011**: Dashboard MUST adapt to different mobile screen sizes while maintaining layout hierarchy
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide loading states for mini widgets during data fetch operations
- **FR-013**: Chat area MUST support different message types (text, confirmations, success notifications)
- **FR-014**: System MUST persist dashboard state across app sessions
- **FR-015**: Mini widgets MUST handle offline states gracefully with appropriate indicators

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Dashboard**: Main container managing layout, state, and navigation between chat and widgets
- **Chat Area**: Primary interaction zone handling conversations, confirmations, and feedback messages
- **Mini Widget**: Compact information display with state management, animations, and tap-to-expand functionality
- **Full View**: Detailed screens accessible from mini widgets with full CRUD operations and navigation
- **Navigation Context**: State management for maintaining user context across different views and interactions
