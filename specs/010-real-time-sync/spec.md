# Feature Specification: Real-time Google Services Sync

**Feature Branch**: `010-real-time-sync`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Bidirectional real-time synchronization between mobile app and Google services (Calendar, Tasks, Gmail) with conflict resolution"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   â†’ Feature: Real-time bidirectional sync with Google Workspace services
2. Extract key concepts from description
   â†’ Actors: Mobile users, Google services, Multiple devices, Sync engine
   â†’ Actions: Sync data, resolve conflicts, handle offline changes, maintain consistency
   â†’ Data: Calendar events, tasks, emails, sync timestamps, conflict resolutions
   â†’ Constraints: Network reliability, API rate limits, battery optimization, data consistency
3. All aspects clarified through Q&A session
4. User scenarios defined for sync workflows and conflict handling
5. Functional requirements generated covering sync mechanisms and reliability
6. Key entities identified (Sync Engine, Conflict Resolver, Change Queue, Sync State)
7. Review checklist completed - no clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Guidelines
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ðŸš« Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- ðŸ‘¥ Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users experience seamless synchronization between their mobile app and Google services, where changes made in either location appear automatically in the other without manual refresh. When conflicts occur (same item edited in both places), the system intelligently resolves them or asks for user input, ensuring data consistency across all platforms.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user creates event in mobile app, **When** sync occurs, **Then** event appears in Google Calendar within 30 seconds without user action
2. **Given** user marks task complete in Google Tasks, **When** mobile app syncs, **Then** task shows as completed in mobile interface automatically
3. **Given** user edits event in mobile while offline, **When** connection returns, **Then** changes sync to Google Calendar with queued updates
4. **Given** same event edited simultaneously in mobile and Google, **When** conflict detected, **Then** user sees conflict resolution dialog with both versions
5. **Given** user receives new email in Gmail, **When** app is active, **Then** email count updates in mobile interface without manual refresh
6. **Given** sync fails due to network issues, **When** connection restores, **Then** system automatically retries and completes pending synchronization
7. **Given** user makes multiple rapid changes, **When** sync processes, **Then** all changes batch efficiently without overwhelming Google APIs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Google API rate limits are exceeded?
- How does system handle partial sync failures (some items sync, others don't)?
- What if user's Google account permissions change during sync?
- How are large amounts of historical data handled during initial sync?
- What happens when device clock is significantly wrong?
- How does system handle corrupted or invalid data from Google services?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically sync changes from mobile app to Google services within 30 seconds
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically sync changes from Google services to mobile app within 60 seconds
- **FR-003**: System MUST queue changes made while offline and sync when connection returns
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect conflicts when same item is modified in both mobile and Google simultaneously
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide conflict resolution interface showing both versions for user choice
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement last-write-wins strategy for simple conflicts (timestamps differ by >5 minutes)
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle Google API rate limits with exponential backoff and retry logic
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide sync status indicators (syncing, success, error, offline queue length)
- **FR-009**: System MUST support manual sync refresh with pull-to-refresh gesture
- **FR-010**: System MUST batch multiple rapid changes to optimize API usage and performance
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain sync state persistence across app restarts and device reboots
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle partial sync failures gracefully with specific error reporting
- **FR-013**: System MUST respect device battery optimization settings for background sync frequency
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide sync history and troubleshooting information for debugging
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure data integrity with validation before and after sync operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sync Engine**: Core system managing bidirectional synchronization between mobile app and Google services
- **Conflict Resolver**: Component detecting and resolving data conflicts with user interaction when needed
- **Change Queue**: Offline storage for pending changes that need synchronization when connection returns
- **Sync State**: Persistent tracking of synchronization status, timestamps, and error conditions for all services
