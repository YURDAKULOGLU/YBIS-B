# Feature Specification: Chat AI Integration

**Feature Branch**: `003-chat-ai-integration`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Chat AI integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   â†’ Feature: AI-powered chat system for conversational interface
2. Extract key concepts from description
   â†’ Actors: End users, AI assistants, System administrators
   â†’ Actions: Send messages, receive AI responses, maintain conversation context
   â†’ Data: Chat messages, conversation threads, AI model configurations
   â†’ Constraints: Real-time responses, conversation memory, multi-modal support
3. All aspects clarified through Q&A session
4. User scenarios defined for chat interactions and AI responses
5. Functional requirements generated covering chat flow and AI integration
6. Key entities identified (User, Conversation, Message, AI Context)
7. Review checklist completed - no clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Guidelines
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ðŸš« Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- ðŸ‘¥ Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users can engage in natural conversations with an AI assistant through a chat interface. The AI provides intelligent responses, maintains conversation context, and can help with various tasks including answering questions, providing recommendations, and assisting with productivity workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user opens the chat interface, **When** they type a message, **Then** AI responds within 3 seconds with relevant information
2. **Given** user is in an ongoing conversation, **When** they reference previous messages, **Then** AI maintains context and provides coherent responses
3. **Given** user asks a complex question, **When** AI needs clarification, **Then** system prompts user for additional details
4. **Given** user sends an image or document, **When** AI processes the content, **Then** system provides relevant analysis or answers
5. **Given** user starts a new conversation, **When** they begin typing, **Then** system shows typing indicators and response status
6. **Given** conversation becomes lengthy, **When** context limit is reached, **Then** system intelligently summarizes and maintains key information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when AI service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does system handle inappropriate or harmful user inputs?
- What if user sends very large files or images?
- How are conversation threads managed when user switches devices?
- What happens when AI generates potentially incorrect information?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide real-time chat interface with message input and display
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate with AI service to generate intelligent responses
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain conversation context across multiple message exchanges
- **FR-004**: System MUST support text-based conversations with rich formatting
- **FR-005**: System MUST support image and document upload for AI analysis
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide typing indicators and response status updates
- **FR-007**: System MUST store conversation history for user reference
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to start new conversation threads
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide conversation search and filtering capabilities
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle AI service failures gracefully with fallback responses
- **FR-012**: System MUST support conversation export and sharing
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide message timestamps and delivery status
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to delete or edit their messages
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement content filtering for inappropriate inputs

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents chat participant with profile, preferences, and conversation access
- **Conversation**: Represents chat thread with metadata, participants, and message history
- **Message**: Represents individual chat message with content, timestamp, sender, and status
- **AI Context**: Represents conversation state for AI including memory, preferences, and session data
- **Attachment**: Represents files, images, or documents shared in conversations
