## ðŸ“‹ Quick Guidelines
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ðŸš« Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- ðŸ‘¥ Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users can access a comprehensive calendar interface through their mobile app, viewing their Google Calendar events in month and day views, creating new events with details, editing existing events, and seeing real-time synchronization with their Google Calendar. The interface provides touch-friendly navigation and quick access to daily scheduling needs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user taps calendar mini-widget, **When** calendar screen opens, **Then** current month view displays with today highlighted and events visible
2. **Given** user is viewing month calendar, **When** they tap a date, **Then** day view opens showing that date's events in chronological order
3. **Given** user wants to create event, **When** they tap FAB or "+" button, **Then** create event form opens with date/time pickers and details fields
4. **Given** user creates new event, **When** they save it, **Then** event appears in calendar view and syncs to Google Calendar with confirmation
5. **Given** user taps existing event, **When** event details open, **Then** they can view full details and access edit/delete options
6. **Given** user edits event, **When** changes are saved, **Then** calendar updates locally and syncs changes to Google Calendar
7. **Given** user pulls to refresh, **When** sync completes, **Then** latest Google Calendar events appear with sync timestamp

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to create event during network outage?
- How does interface handle very long event titles or descriptions?
- What if user has conflicting events at same time?
- How are all-day events displayed differently from timed events?
- What happens when Google Calendar sync fails?
- How does interface handle different time zones?
