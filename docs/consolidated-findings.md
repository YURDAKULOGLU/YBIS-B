# Consolidated Findings Overview

## API Contract & Feature Gaps
- Calendar client payloads do not match backend schema expectations (missing `userId`, `action`, nested `params`, and body-level `idempotencyKey`).
- Gmail client exposes unsupported routes and omits required fields (`userId`, single-string recipients) that backend validators demand.
- Tasks and notes API clients publish helpers the backend lacks (stats, bulk actions, star/archive/tag flows), producing consistent 404 responses.
- Planner clarification handler always returns the event title prompt regardless of missing field context; task/note prompts are incorrect.

## Platform & Build System Instability
- Axios and Node.js versions differ across workspaces, leading to non-deterministic installs; repository lacks a unified version enforcement script.
- Metro bundler resolves packages against `src` folders via proxy aliasing instead of compiled `dist` outputs, causing production bundles to include untranspiled TypeScript.
- Metro cannot resolve `@babel/runtime/helpers/interopRequireDefault`; proxy-based `extraNodeModules` is insufficient, and Jest falls over when transforming React Native dependencies.
- Metro startup scripts require manual cache resets and node_modules pruning; automation is missing, so environment drift reappears.
- React Native CLI warns about nonstandard `react-native.config.js` shape; combined with Metro resolver issues, this signals configuration drift from supported templates.
- Jest command (`npm run test --workspace apps/mobile`) fails because React Native dependencies (e.g., `react-native-gesture-handler`) are not transformed under the current Babel config.

## Missing Integrations & Persistence
- Backend Tasks API still uses in-memory mock data despite documentation promising Google Tasks integration.
- Mobile app lacks Google OAuth flow, preventing Workspace account linkage and subsequent sync operations.
- Chat execution plans persist only in a process-local `Map`, risking data loss on restarts or multi-instance deployments.

## Runtime & Quality Gates
- React/React Native/TypeScript versions lack alignment with officially supported combinations, and CI pipeline for lint/type/test is not established.
- Repository currently operates without comprehensive automated quality gates or integration coverage for critical tool endpoints (calendar, gmail, tasks, notes).

## UX & Content Issues
- Dashboard welcome banner and quick action rows show garbled characters ("Welcome back ??", replacement glyphs), indicating Unicode/emoji encoding problems.
- Mobile status bar uses `dark-content` while default dashboard backgrounds are dark, leading to unreadable icons.

## Documentation & Knowledge Base Review
- Existing docs (`comprehensive-codebase-analysis-report`, `current-architecture`, `full-app-blueprint`, `system-ops-overview`, `project-vision`, `ybis-beta-development-spec`) thoroughly outline vision, architecture, operational history, and beta goals but highlight unresolved technical debt noted above.
- CLAUDE guidelines reinforce requirements for API envelopes, Zod validation, telemetry, and role expectations; code must be audited to ensure compliance.
- Specs covering Google Workspace integration, chat AI behavior, adaptive UI, and real-time sync define acceptance criteria that remain unmet given the gaps above.

## Recommended Immediate Next Steps
1. Publish precise Metro resolver mappings (or custom `resolveRequest`) and add workspace-level `@babel/runtime` dependency to eliminate bundler/test failures.
2. Harmonize dependency and engine versions, generating lockfile updates and adding CI scripts (`deps:check`, lint, type, test) to enforce alignment.
3. Scope roadmap to bring API clients and backend implementations back into parity (calendar, gmail, tasks, notes), adding regression coverage per CLAUDE/spec requirements.
4. Implement Google OAuth flow end-to-end and migrate Tasks API to real Google integrations to satisfy documented MVP commitments.
5. Address UI text artifacts and status bar styling while planning future adaptive UI work per vertical specs.
